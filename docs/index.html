        couple to get started with.

        <p>February 2024, I enjoy YT and Twitch and have watched Prime and Thor for years, background sounds help when I am
            working.</p>
        <p>“Go make games”, Thor says – mmm, okay.</p>
        <p>I learnt coding by copying games from magazines. The first computer I owned had its language printed on the keyboard.
            So I couldn't turn it on without wondering, what does that statement do, how does it work? I believe it gave myself
            a good start, not only learning how to code but learning how to learn in a time before the internet. What it didn't
            teach was structure, the code in those magazines were brutal for their lack of structure. That took quite a while to
            self learn.</p>
        <p>I like to have a few projects on the go, Cy is a language I worked on over the great stay indoors of 2020,
            coincidently I was made redundant just at the start of lockdown. Given a handful of cash and told to stay at home, I
            must of been one of the few who enjoyed that year.
            The main idea of Cy is that multithreading is an integral part of the language and not an add on library. We have
            CPUs with many cores but use languages designed to use one of them, that's worse than graphics cards with loads of
            display ports and monitors with loads of hdmi ports…
            Another is Lucky Sud, a game I was writing using Game Maker – btw an excellent game engine, but I didn't feel at
            home with the language it uses, it has a lack of data hiding. Maybe try this with a language I want to work with for
            the next few years.</p>
        <p>I had started working on Sud but for the ZX Spectrum Next, so I have a basic plan. The game type is
            survival, RPG adventure, using retro graphics – top down faux 3d effect, ideal for the Speccy but also fun on a PC.
            The story is you are Lucky Sud, so named as his father is a lye maker and you have an amazing knack of life just
            being easy for you.</p>
        <p>On the night of The Harvest Celebrations, you push your luck a tad too far.
            You drink, dance and party. You have fun with each of the Mayors daughters, three of them, without each other
            knowing - a busy night.
            You drink, you drink and then you wake up the next morning with only a few vague memories swimming around your head
            as you lie, wrapped around the village well. You open your eyes to see that the whole village looking at you and
            not in that usual loving way.</p>
        <p>As the villagers persuade you to leave, with severe use of their pitchforks and axes, you hear a few things from
            last night your don't remember. You protest and say these things didn't happen, you just danced and drank. The
            portcullis falls with a clunk behind you, they don't believe you.</p>
        <p>What now, it is early in the day, but you have no food or water. You protest to the villagers through the bars of the
            portcullis. They give in and throw out a hunting knife, saying, “You're on your own, good luck and good
            riddance!”</p>
        <p>After that you have choices, make up with the villagers (after figuring out what you have to make up for) or
            just go it alone in the wilderness. Either way food, shelter and water will be handy sooner rather than later.</p>

        <p>January 2024, I have been made redundant. Shit happens. A little over three years and I thoroughly enjoyed 99% of
            it.</p>
        <p>Now what? I was coding web applications, not my usual thing (well apart from
            years of php previously and the occasional FastCGI app) but something different is fun and I
            worked with a great crowd. Fellow workers can lift a crappy job to become fun and this was far from a crappy
            job.</p>

    <li class="item-frame"><a href="./HowToHostWebsite">How to Host a Website</a>
        <p>This tutorial shows you how to host your own site – and how I host this
            one. This is about how to get a host name, DNS, hosting and ways of keeping it in sync using as
            cheap and minimal setup as is reasonable.</p>

    <li class="item-frame"><a href="./OpenGL">OpenGL Tutorials</a>
        <p>Group of tutorials, starting with the simplest of OpenGL applications.
            The aim here is to have code that is portable, concise and will work with as many Operating Systems as
            possible.</p>
