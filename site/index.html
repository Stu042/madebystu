                <p class="page-index-info">January 2024, I have been made redundant. Shit happens. A little over three years in this job and I would say it was my favourite.</p>
                <p class="page-index-info">Now what? I was coding web applications, not my usual thing (well apart from 4 years of php previously and the occasional fastcgi app). Something different is fun and I was working with a great crowd. Fellow workers can be enough of a lift on their own to make a crappy job fun and this wasn't a crappy job.</p>
                <p class="page-index-info">I originally learnt coding by copying games from ZX Spectrum mags - this was common back when most of you weren't born. Learned a lot of good and bad - my first bubble sort was in ZX Basic! Code organisation was not a big thing though, but in those days I could keep track of all the variables in my head. Time marches on and that skill left me a long time ago.</p>
                <p>ZX Basic was fun and easy to learn, the keyboard literally showed you every command, I just had to learn how to use them. Using Basic I created my first games, a kind of 3d car racing game, this really highlighted the limits with the Speccy graphics when using Basic. So a few years later I self taught myself Z80 assembly, it is interesting how using less commands but with more performance can really make programming a lot more fun.</p>

                <p class="page-index-info">This tutorial shows you how to host your own site - and how I host this
                    one. This is about how to get a host name, DNS, hosting and ways of keeping it in sync using as
                    cheap and minimal setup as is reasonable.</p>

                    The aim here is to have code that is portable, concise amd will work in as many environments as
                    possible.</p>
